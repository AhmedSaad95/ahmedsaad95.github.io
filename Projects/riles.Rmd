### Introduction

Since I’m fan of Riles and his songs, I came with an idea to better understand his lyrics which is collecting data (songs’ names, lyrics) from [this website](https://www.paroles-musique.com/) and analysing them using word cloud.

**Word clouds** are used to visualize language and word frequency. A word cloud will use size, color, and position to accent words that are more frequent in a given text. They are a qualitative visualization that can be produced from text analysis.

### Who's Riles ?
Rilès Kacimi  , born 4 January 1996, better known by his stage name Rilès, is a French **rapper**, **songwriter**, **composer** and **record producer** from Rouen.

All his songs are written in English, thanks to his advanced level in this language after studuing English literature at the University of Rouen.

### Song's length:
I created a variable **length** that containes the number of words per song and I ploted it:

```{r plot,warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(
  x = db$songs,
  y = db$length,
  name = "Length per song",
  type = "bar"
)%>%
  layout(title = "Number of words per song",
         xaxis = list(title = "song"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of words"))
```




### Words frequency table:

You can also see rhe words frequency here :

```{r words}
texts <- db$lyrics
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(texts))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, PlainTextDocument)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords('english'))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, c("and", "this", "there")) 
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(corpus))
dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(corpus)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
d <- d[-which(d$word %in% c("and","this","that","fuck","shit")),]
datatable(d,class='compact',options = list(
  initComplete = JS(
    "function(settings, json) {",
    "$(this.api().table().header()).css({'background-color': '#000', 'color': '#fff'});",
    "}")
))
set.seed(1234)
```



### Word Cloud


```{r wordcloud}

wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```
